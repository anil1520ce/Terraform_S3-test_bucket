Terraform

   Terraform is an open-source infrastructure as a code (IAAC) tool developed by HashiCorp. It allows you to define and manage your infrastructure as a code, which means you can write configuration files in a high-level language that describe the resources you need for your infrastructure, such as virtual machines, networks, storage accounts, and more. Terraform then uses these configuration files to create, modify, and delete the infrastructure resources, making it easier to manage and automate infrastructure deployments.
   Terraform is a popular tool for managing infrastructure as a code, and its flexibility and ease of use make it a favorite among developers and DevOps teams.

S3-Bucket

   An S3 bucket is a storage resource provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) for storing objects, such as files and data, in the cloud. S3 stands for Simple Storage Service, and it's designed to be highly scalable, durable, and cost-effective.

S3 buckets can be used for various purposes, including data backups, static website hosting, data archiving, and more. You can store any type of data in an S3 bucket, such as text, images, videos, and even database backups.
